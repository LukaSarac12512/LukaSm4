	<h1 style="color:darkblue;font-family:verdana;text-align:center;"> BMW M4</h1>
	<p style="color:darkblue;font-family:verdana;font-size:200%;text-align:center;">The BMW M4 is a high-performance coupe that shares its roots with the M3 but offers a more focused, sporty design. Launched in 2014, the M4 took over from the M3 coupe, elevating the driving experience to new heights with sharper handling, aggressive styling, and a more refined approach to performance.

Key Highlights:
Powerful Engine Options: The M4 is powered by a 3.0L twin-turbocharged inline-six, producing over 430 horsepower in its standard form, and up to 503 hp in the M4 GTS and Competition models.

Stunning Design: With a low, wide stance, muscular body lines, and signature kidney grilles, the M4 has a more aggressive look compared to the M3, emphasizing its performance-oriented nature.

Dynamic Performance: Thanks to an M xDrive all-wheel-drive system (in newer models) and an adaptive suspension, the M4 delivers razor-sharp handling while maintaining comfort for everyday driving.

Track-Ready: Whether you choose the standard or the M4 GTS model, it’s a car that can excel on both the street and the racetrack, offering incredible agility and precise steering feedback.

The BMW M4 is the ideal choice for those seeking a dynamic, high-performance coupe with a perfect mix of luxury and raw power. It’s built for enthusiasts who want the M3’s capabilities in a more stylish and performance-focused package.
